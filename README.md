# GR10-badger-art
Hackathon: GR10: Art Bounty

Work Plan


My project is to use disruptive-guerilla marketing tactics to raise awareness of DeFi crypto options outside the legacy financial institutions.
We would print vinyl die-cut OR magnets (less permanent) to stick on or near financial institutions ATMs. This would target tech savvy spenders & potential users to Badger Dao who may be already be curious to alternative finance & DeFi.
The already eye catching Badger logo with the QR code would draw users to click and open the QR link.
The first thing the user sees...
Community Rules Everything
DAO dedicated to building products and infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to DeFi.
The https://badger.finance/ landing page.
The rest is history. They adopt. Network effect kicks in.
Boom.
