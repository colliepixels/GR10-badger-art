# GR10-badger-art
Hackathon: GR10: Art Bounty

Work Plan

My project will use disruptive-guerilla marketing tactics. I plan to raise awareness of Badger DeFi & crypto options outside of the legacy financial institutions.
We will print vinyl die-cut stickersor magnets with a QR code linking to Badger.Finance. The plan is to then stick on/or near financial institutions ATMs & other high vis spots. This targets tech savvy spenders & potential users of Badger Dao. These users are most likely curious to alternative finance, DeFi & crypto.
The already eye catching Badger logo with the QR code, would draw users to click and open the QR link.
The first thing the user sees...
Community Rules Everything
DAO dedicated to building products and infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to DeFi.
The https://badger.finance/ landing page.

The rest is history. They adopt. Network effect kicks in.
Boom.
